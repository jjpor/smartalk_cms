<div class="mt-4 text-slate-600">
    <p>In today's work culture, long hours and constant connectivity are often mistaken for dedication. But studies show
        that strategic rest is essential to avoid burnout and maintain high performance. While extended sabbaticals may
        be out of reach for many, well-timed short breaks can have a significant impact on mental clarity, emotional
        regulation, and creative thinking.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">Despite the benefits, many employees feel pressure to "power through" the day, fearing judgment or
        appearing unproductive. These internal and external pressures lead to "stealth breaks" - moments of rest taken
        in secret, often tainted by guilt or anxiety, and therefore less effective.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">Effective breaks, however, are intentional and restorative. Whether it's a quick walk, ten minutes
        of quiet, or a moment to connect with a colleague, these pauses help reset your mental state. Organizations that
        normalize and support healthy breaks see improved morale, resilience, and productivity across the board. But in
        many cases, it's up to employees to self-advocate for time off and structure their day in ways that protect
        their energy and well-being.</p>
