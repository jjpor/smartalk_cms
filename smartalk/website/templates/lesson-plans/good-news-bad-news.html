        <h4 class="font-bold text-red-800 mb-2">CEO Who Fired 900 Employees Via Zoom</h4>
        <p>Vishal Garg, CEO of unicorn mortgage lender startup Better.com—after receiving a $750 million cash infusion with a valuation of around $7 billion—bluntly informed his 900 employees that a large number of people will be fired in a cold, awkward one-way video announcement.</p>
        <p>Looking visibly uncomfortable, Garg said that 15% of the workforce would be laid off. In a monotone voice, the chief executive stated, “This is the second time in my career I’m doing this and I do not want to do this. The last time I did it, I cried; this time I hope to be stronger.”</p>
        <p>Three of Better.com’s top executives have reportedly resigned from the company after the unicorn mortgage lender was hit by a wave of backlash over the leaked Zoom call.</p>
        <p>In a message from the founder and CEO, Garg issued an apology on the company’s blog. The chief executive wrote, “I want to apologize for the way I handled the layoffs last week.” He continued, “I failed to show the appropriate amount of respect and appreciation for the individuals who were affected... I own the decision to do the layoffs, but in communicating it, I blundered the execution. In doing so, I embarrassed you.”</p>
        
        <h5 class="font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">Article Continued</h5>
        <p>Fortune reported that the embattled CEO accused “at least 250″ terminated staffers of stealing from the company by working just two hours a day. In an email obtained by Forbes, Garg brazenly wrote, “HELLO—WAKE UP BETTER TEAM. You are TOO DAMN SLOW. You are a bunch of DUMB DOLPHINS... STOP IT RIGHT NOW. YOU ARE EMBARRASSING ME.”</p>
        <p>History seems like it's repeating itself. On Tuesday, the company took the "difficult step of streamlining" its operations by laying off 3,000 more people. Better said that employees impacted would be properly notified personally over the phone.</p>
        <p>In what seems like a glitch, workers were notified of their firings by seeing a severance payment in their bank accounts.</p>
