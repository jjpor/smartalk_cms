            <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-slate-800 mb-2">Research is Key</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600">Understand the market value for your role in your industry and location. Websites like Glassdoor, Payscale, or industry reports can provide valuable insights. Be ready to explain why you believe you deserve a higher salary.</p>

            <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-slate-800 mb-2">Timing is Everything</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600">Ideally, negotiate after you've received a job offer but before you've accepted it. This is when the employer is most motivated to hire you. If you're already employed, choose an appropriate time, such as during a performance review or when you've achieved significant results.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-slate-800 mb-2">Practice Your Pitch</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600">Clearly communicate your value to the organization. Highlight your accomplishments, skills, and any additional responsibilities you've taken on. Practice your talking points with a friend or mentor to build confidence.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-slate-800 mb-2">Be Confident and Positive</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600">Approach the negotiation with confidence, but remain positive and respectful. Focus on the value you bring to the organization rather than making it a confrontational conversation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-slate-800 mb-2">Consider the Whole Package</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600">Don't just focus on the base salary. Consider other benefits such as bonuses, stock options, health care, retirement plans, and vacation time. Employers sometimes have flexibility in non-salary components.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
                <h3 class="font-bold text-slate-800 mb-2">Understand Your Priorities</h3>
                <p class="text-slate-600">Identify your "non-negotiables" and the areas where you might be more flexible. This will help you navigate the negotiation process more effectively.</p>

                        <li><strong>Tier 1 (Base):</strong> Define your simplest offering. What is the minimum service/product a client can get from you? What's the price?</li>
                        <li><strong>Tier 2 (Growth):</strong> What features or services can you add to the base tier to increase its value? What does this tier cost?</li>
                        <li><strong>Tier 3 (Premium):</strong> What is your top-tier, most comprehensive offering? What exclusive benefits or services does it include? What is its price?</li>
                        <li><strong>Negotiation Practice:</strong> When a client says "your price is too high" during a negotiation, you can quickly pivot to a lower-tier offering instead of simply lowering your price, maintaining your value.</li>
