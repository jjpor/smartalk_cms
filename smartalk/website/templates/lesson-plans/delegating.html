                            <p><strong>Task selection:</strong> Choose tasks suitable for delegation. Not every task should be delegated. Good candidates are tasks that are routine, time-consuming, or offer a good learning opportunity for a team member.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Matchmaking:</strong> Assign tasks to the right person based on their skills, strengths, and development goals. A good match increases the likelihood of success and makes the task more rewarding for the team member.</p>

                        <li>

                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Empowerment:</strong> Once you've delegated, you must empower the individual to make decisions. Provide resources, monitor progress, and offer guidance, but don't micromanage.</p>
