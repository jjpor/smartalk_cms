        <p class="mt-4 text-slate-700">Jane worked for many years as a live-in caregiver. After her family member passed away, she lost her sense of purpose and started a cleaning job at a university. She felt ashamed and thought she wasn't doing something "important."</p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">One day, her supervisor gave her a dictionary and asked her to read the definition of "custodian": someone responsible for looking after something. "That's you," he said. "You take care of this place and the people in it."</p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">That small moment changed Jane's thinking. She stayed in the job for 18 years and said it was one of the first times in her life that she felt valued. She realized she mattered.</p>

    <div class="reading-text">
        <p class="mt-4 text-slate-700">"Mattering" means feeling like you are important to others-because they value you and your contributions. It is more than just "belonging." Belonging is about feeling accepted in a group. Mattering is about knowing that you make a difference in that group.</p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-slate-700">When people feel like they matter at work, they have better self-esteem, more motivation, and are less likely to quit. In one study of over 7,000 teams, the groups where people felt cared for had better customer satisfaction and profits.</p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-slate-700">Leaders can help people feel they matter by doing three things:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>See and Hear People</strong> - Notice how they're doing, ask questions, and truly listen to their answers. For example, ask "What has your attention today?" instead of just "How are you?"</li>
            <li><strong>Affirm People</strong> - Show them what makes them special-like their strengths, ideas, or hard work. Be specific and sincere.</li>
            <li><strong>Show They're Needed</strong> - Help people understand how their work connects to something bigger. Even a janitor at NASA once said, "I'm helping put a man on the moon," because he knew his work mattered.</li>
