Without specific examples, it's hard to know what success looks like. Vague feedback happens more often as you move up in a company. Leaders are busy, and feedback becomes softer, talking about things like "vision" or "alignment." Sometimes bosses are too overwhelmed or not trained to give clear feedback.</p>
