            <p class="text-justify leading-relaxed text-sm">She works with very diverse people, from those who want to gain confidence in speaking to those who aim to refine English in complex professional contexts. Italian-English bilingual, with a background in law, she has a clear, strategic, and flexible approach, suitable for those looking for concrete results. She has been supporting managers, entrepreneurs, and professionals for years, helping them bring their English to a more strategic, targeted, and conscious level. She quickly grasps not only linguistic but also emotional dynamics: she knows when the problem is a sentence, and when it's a limiting belief. She works on what truly makes a difference: pronunciation, structure, fluency, and confidence. Over time, she has helped her students transform their English: not just to speak better, but to be truly heard.</p>

            <p class="text-justify leading-relaxed text-sm">Trina is gentle, empathetic, and precise, but she always keeps a high focus on the improvement path. She is an expert in teaching grammar, making concepts accessible and engaging without overwhelming the learning process. Her students describe her as welcoming yet firm, capable of instilling confidence while clearly pointing out areas for improvement. In a memorable case, she managed to make a person, who until then thought they couldn't even formulate two words in the presence of a native speaker, express themselves confidently in English. And from that moment, growth has been unstoppable.</p>
